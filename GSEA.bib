	abstract = {Increasing quantitative data generated from transcriptomics and proteomics require integrative strategies for analysis. Here, we present an R package, {clusterProfiler} that automates the process of biological-term classification and the enrichment analysis of gene clusters. The analysis module and visualization module were combined into a reusable workflow. Currently, {clusterProfiler} supports three species, including humans, mice, and yeast. Methods provided in this package can be easily extended to other species and ontologies. The {clusterProfiler} package is released under Artistic-2.0 License within Bioconductor project. The source code and vignette are freely available at http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/{clusterProfiler}.html},
